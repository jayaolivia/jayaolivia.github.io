<h1>About me</h1>
I am a freelance writer for various online and print publications local to Northern Virginia. As a <a href="https://www.fairfaxtimes.com/positive_vibes/" target=”_blank”>columnist</a> at Fairfax County Times and contributing writer for Rappahannock Media, I am a features and news journalist specializing in local businesses, health/science, education, and arts/entertainment.
<br>
I practiced concise writing while pursuing a Bachelor of Science in biology from George Mason University, which (ironically) only strengthened my ability to dress my writing up.
