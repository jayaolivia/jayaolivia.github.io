<h1>About me</h1>
I am a freelance writer for various online and print publications local to Northern Virginia. As a <a href="https://www.fairfaxtimes.com/positive_vibes/" target=”_blank”>columnist</a> at Fairfax County Times and contributing writer for Rappahannock Media, I am a features and news journalist specializing in local businesses, health/science, education, and arts/entertainment.
<br>
<br>
I practiced concise writing while pursuing a Bachelor of Science in biology from George Mason University, which (ironically) only strengthened my ability to dress my writing up. From literature reviews and grant proposals to magazine features and investigative stories, I've explored diversity in writing styles and subjects.
<br>
<br>
Saddled with a plethora of interests, my underlying curiosity is for learning. I'm exploring all the ways writing can shape and convey all there is to learn out there.
