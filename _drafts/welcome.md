You're here because I bit the bullet. With the help of my technology-literate friend, I took charge of my own Google results. I would say I made a website but I really just accepted one that said friend kindly created (thanks, Alex!).

I didn't think I would ever be Googleable but, much like fame, one day it just happened. Come to discover that other people who create things also have websites??? The memo must have gotten lost in the mail.

Although, my address does seem to change with the seasons. Speaking of, I'm in the mountains of Colorado with Fairfax, Virginia on the brain... or should I say Fairfax, Va (AP Style).
